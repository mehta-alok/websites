# Lovable Prompt — Garcia's Mexican Food (San Antonio)

> **What this is.** A ready-to-paste prompt that tells Lovable to build a fully functional website (real booking/reservation/quote system + owner admin dashboard) for **Garcia's Mexican Food**. Real data, real Yelp reviews, real address — already filled in.
>
> **How to use.**
> 1. Open https://lovable.dev/ and start a new project.
> 2. Copy everything below (both STEP 1 and STEP 2) and paste it into the chat.
> 3. When Lovable asks to connect Supabase, say yes.
> 4. Add a Resend API key (free 3K emails/mo) when prompted — that powers booking/quote notifications.
> 5. In Supabase Auth, add one user with **the owner**'s email + a password. That's their admin login.
> 6. Publish → get the live URL → send it to the owner.

>
> ### Pages / sections (single-page, sticky nav, smooth scroll)
> 1. **Hero** — restaurant name in serif, one-line tagline matching the brand feel, two CTAs: "Reserve a Table" (scrolls to Reservations) and "Order Online" (opens a placeholder URL — owner adds DoorDash/Grubhub/Uber Eats links). Full-bleed food background image, dark overlay for contrast.
> 2. **Menu** — display every dish from STEP 1 as cards with name, price, and one-line description. Group naturally if needed (Apps, Mains, Sides, Drinks).
> 3. **Reservations** (CORE FEATURE) — date picker (no past dates, no closed days), 30-minute time slots within business hours, party-size dropdown (1–10), name/phone/email + optional notes. On submit: insert into Supabase `reservations` table, show confirmation, fire a Resend email to the owner.
> 4. **Online Ordering** — three big buttons linking to DoorDash, Grubhub, Uber Eats (placeholder URLs — owner fills in).
> 5. **Gallery** — 8-image responsive grid with click-to-enlarge lightbox. Use tasteful food photos.
