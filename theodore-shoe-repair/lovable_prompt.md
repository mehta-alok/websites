## STEP 2 — Paste the STEP 1 block above + this prompt into Lovable

> Build a fully functional service-contractor website. Use React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Backend: Supabase (Lovable will prompt to connect — say yes).
>
> **The business:** *(the STEP 1 block above)*
>
> ### Pages / sections (single-page, sticky nav, smooth scroll)
> 1. **Hero** — business name in serif, one-line tagline, two CTAs: "Get a Free Quote" (scrolls to Quote form) and "Call Now" (tel: link). Full-bleed background image fitting the trade.
>    
> 2. **Services** — display each service from STEP 1 as a card with name, starting price, and a one-line description.
> 3. **Quote Request** (CORE FEATURE) — service type dropdown, name, phone, email, service address, optional details/photo upload. On submit: insert into Supabase `quotes` table, show confirmation, fire a Resend email + (optional) SMS to the owner so they can respond fast.
> 4. **Service Area** — bullet list of cities/areas the business serves.
> 5. **Gallery** — 8-image grid showing recent work (before/after where applicable).
> 6. **Reviews — LIVE from Google** (this is what sells the site). In a Supabase edge function:
>    - Call Places API `findplacefromtext` with `input = "{BUSINESS NAME from STEP 1} {FULL ADDRESS from STEP 1}"` to resolve the `place_id`.
>    - Call Places API `place/details` with that `place_id` and `fields=reviews,rating,user_ratings_total,url`.
>    - Render the 3 most relevant reviews: 5-star row, reviewer's real name + profile photo (from the API response), relative time ("a month ago"), verbatim review text (truncate at ~200 chars with "Read more" linking to Google).
>    - Show the overall rating + total count ("{rating}★ · {count} reviews on Google").
>    - Cache the API response in a Supabase table for 24 hours (Places API has quotas).
>    - Add a prominent "Read all reviews on Google" button linking to the API's returned Maps `url`.
>    - **Fallback** if the API call fails or `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` isn't set: render the verbatim Yelp reviews from STEP 1 plus an honest rating-and-count callout.
> 7. **Visit / Contact** — address, embedded Google Map, hours, click-to-call (prominent), Get Directions.
> 8. **Contact form** — name, email, phone, message → Supabase `messages` + owner email.
> 9. **Footer** — name, address, phone, hours, social icons.
>
> ### Functional features (non-negotiable)
> - **Quote system** — Supabase `quotes` table (id, service, name, phone, email, address, details, status, created_at). Email + optional SMS to owner on each new quote.
> - **Contact form** — Supabase `messages` + owner email.
> - **Owner admin dashboard at `/admin`** — Supabase Auth. Two tabs: **Quotes** (table with Contacted / Quoted / Won / Lost statuses, sortable by date and status) and **Messages** (newest first, mark-as-read).
>
> ### Design + SEO
> - Mobile-first, fast, accessible. Use the brand-feel colors from STEP 1.
> - Click-to-call phone visible everywhere on mobile.
> - Serif headings, clean sans body. Subtle scroll animations.
> - Proper title, meta, Open Graph, LocalBusiness JSON-LD.
>
> Build the complete site now. Start with the full layout + quote system + live Google reviews, then the admin dashboard.
>
> ### Required environment variables (Lovable will prompt)
> - `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` — get one at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis (enable "Places API"). Free $200/month credit covers far more than this site will use. **This powers the live Google reviews — the most important authenticity feature.**
> - `RESEND_API_KEY` — get one at https://resend.com (3K emails/month free). Powers the quote/contact email notifications.
